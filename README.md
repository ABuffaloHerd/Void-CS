# Void-CS
Text game to practice OOP concepts

## Battle system
Attacking does what you think it does.
Defending doubles **base** defense and res for the next incoming attack.

### These aren't done yet
Using a spell does what you think it does, and uses the RES stat instead of DEF like arknights. This costs MP. What a surprise.
Special attacks deal pure damage and hurt. Like they should. This costs SP. What's new?
After killing something you get to take its life essence and level up. Games like to call this EXP.
Additionally, you can take whatever money the monster had and trade it for equipment. How they manage to carry gold around like that i haven't decided.

Using items in the middle of battle seems like a cool idea.

## Monsters
Monsters are randomly generated based on the player's level.
They have random stats and (unimplemented) drop gold / exp.

### Bosses
Bosses are big monsters that hurt more. It would be cool to make them drop special items that aren't trophies, large sums of exp, or the entirety of the US national debt in solid gold bars.

## Shopping
This isn't implemented yet. It's a place to exchange looted gold for more items.

## Dungeons and floors
Walk around (figuratively) and kill things. Then kill a boss. Then do it again.

## Music
Surely there's a way to make a console play music right? I did it in C++
